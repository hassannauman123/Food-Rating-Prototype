In this project, I designed a cutting-edge prototype empowering users to explore and rate nearby restaurants seamlessly. Leveraging my expertise in web-development (JavaScript, CSS, HTML), I crafted a dynamic platform that not only showcased restaurant information but also facilitated user ratings for an enhanced dining experience.

 **Key Responsibilities:**

- User-Centric Design: Conducted thorough user interviews and surveys, delving into the minds of potential users to gather valuable insights. Utilized this firsthand knowledge to tailor the website design to precisely meet user needs and elevate the overall User Experience (UX).

- Interactive Prototyping: Developed interactive prototypes using advanced prototyping tools, experimenting with diverse interface styles to ensure alignment with users' needs and preferences. This iterative process allowed for a user-friendly and intuitive platform.

- Usability Testing: Implemented rigorous usability testing, actively seeking user feedback to identify pain points and areas for improvement. The feedback loop was instrumental in promptly updating the interface, ensuring a responsive and user-centric design.

**Key Achievements:**

- Crafted a prototype that seamlessly integrates Java, CSS, and HTML, providing users with an engaging and visually appealing platform.
- Established a robust connection with users through interviews and surveys, resulting in a design that resonates with their preferences.
- Utilized an iterative approach in prototyping and testing, guaranteeing continuous improvement based on real user insights.

This project helped allow me to put users first in design. I am thrilled to have crafted a prototype that goes beyond meeting user expectations, offering an enriched experience in the dynamic landscape of restaurant exploration and reviews.
